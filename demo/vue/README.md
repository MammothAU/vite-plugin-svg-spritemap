# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Setup

> You need to build the project before using the demo. To do that, run `pnpm build` at the root of the project and after run the following commands in the `demo/vue/` folder.

### Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.
