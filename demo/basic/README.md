# Basic example

> This is a basic example of how to use vite-plugin-svg-spritemap with default vitejs usage.

## Usage

> You need to build the project before using the demo. To do that, run `pnpm build` at the root of the project and after run the following commands in the `demo/basic/` folder.

```shell
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

To change the style language (CSS/Stylus/SCSS/LESS), you need to edit configuration of *vite-plugin-svg-spritemap* inside the `vite.config.ts` to generate the correct file.
You also need to edit the `src/main.ts` script to load the correct style.
