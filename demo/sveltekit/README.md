# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Setup

> You need to build the project before using the demo. To do that, run `pnpm build` at the root of the project and after run the following commands in the `demo/sveltekit/` folder.

### Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
